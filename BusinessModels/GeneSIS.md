  <tr>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        Needs deployment over IoT, Edge and Cloud. Need support for trustworthy deployment (i.e., support for deploying trustworthiness mechanisms and Mechanisms to properly monitor what has been deployed)

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <b>Existing Alternatives</b> </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        
Current solutions: (i) No deployment solution tailored for IoT, Edge, and cloud infrastructure, (ii) No monitoring of the execution flow of the app. This is particularly relevant for debugging on IoT devices (as this is typically a complicated task), (iii) deployment tool do not integrate with security and privacy tools.
