      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        
* Apply access control mechanisms and identity governance mechanisms that today address people accessing IT applications, to people accessing industrial IoT, and to relationships between industrial objects
* Improve global cybersecurity of the middleware and application IoT layers
* Consider privacy risks as an integral part of the dynamic access control process.</p>

      <p>
        
- Today, no protocol can deliver dynamic authorization based on context for both IT and OT (operational technologies) domains. 
* Cloud computing infrastructures do not use dynamic access control, but static traditional mechanisms, despite the highly dynamic nature of cloud computing capabilities.
* As the number of connected devices increases more and more, the related security risks are more and more important.</p>

      <p>Individual and specific KPIs for the solution (KPI to evaluate the success of the exploitation activity):

* Rate of progress in the Life Cycle Management cycle:
  * 100% = GO for General Shipment max 6 months after the end of the project
  * 50% = GO for General Shipment between 6 and 12 months after the end of the project
  * 0% = 12 months after the end of the project there is still no GO for General Shipment

* % of successfull global validation tests

* Filed patents:
  * 100% = 2 patents
  * 50% = 1 patents
  * 0% = 0 patent  </p>

* MS 1 - Middle of ENACT's lifetime: Testing new technology is under progress and TRL 3 reached. Partial results promoted towards Product Line Management. Step 1 in the company Product Life Cycle Management process: formal decision to include in the official roadmap.

* MS 2 -  End of ENACT: Step 2 of the Product Life Cycle Management: GO for industrialization and announcement.  TRL 6/7 reached for some parts TRL8/9. Product management team prepares sales and training material, Delivery team prepares software distribution, Support team prepares helpdesk processes. Revenue increase.

* MS 3 -  After end of ENACT (2 years): Step 3 of the Life Cycle Management (max 6 months after the end of the project): GO for General Shipment.  Press release and communications about the new product offer, now on sale.

* MS 4 -  5 years later: Deployment of the solution at key customers in the manufacturing  sector, acquisition of new customers in other sectors of Industry. Praised by analysts as a major European vendor for IoT security.
