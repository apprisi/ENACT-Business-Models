      <b>Customer needs, requests and opportunities from the market</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        
* Apply access control mechanisms and identity governance mechanisms that today address people accessing IT applications, to people accessing industrial IoT, and to relationships between industrial objects
* Improve global cybersecurity of the middleware and application IoT layers
* Consider privacy risks as an integral part of the dynamic access control process.</p>

      <p>
        
- Today, no protocol can deliver dynamic authorization based on context for both IT and OT (operational technologies) domains. 
* Cloud computing infrastructures do not use dynamic access control, but static traditional mechanisms, despite the highly dynamic nature of cloud computing capabilities.
* As the number of connected devices increases more and more, the related security risks are more and more important.</p>

      <p>

- The resulting IAM offer will deliver new access control mechanisms for authorizing access to industrial objects, with ad hoc protocols, while still being able to address traditional access to IT applications. 

- The resulting IAM offer will in addition secure the access to applications and APIs.

- The authorization decisions will take privacy risk  values into account. Consent management will be enforced by the resulting IAM offer.  </p>

   <tr>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <b> Revenue Sources</b>
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>Main sources of revenue:

* Licences: Perpetual Licenses on a One-Time Fee basis.
The price is  based on the number of users and then  OPTIONS can be ordered.

Minimal order is 100 users, with degressive pricing points at 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 25000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 500000 and 1000000 users. 
Pricing for larger deployments and site licences are directly negotiated on a case by case basis.
Special Pricing is proposed for external users, CUSTOMERS mitigating the price with a 0,25 ratio.
Special Pricing is proposed for external users, BUSINESS PARTNERS mitigating the price with a 0,50 ratio.

In addition, two criteria can significally change the price:
- A global purchase order for the total number of users, rather than an incremental purchase;
- The fact that more than one product is ordered.

OBVIOUSLY taking into account the competition we are facing can also significantly change the pricing offered as well as knowledge of customer budget

* Support & Maintenance: To benefit from updates, in the case of Perpetual Licenses, a customer must subscribe to a Standard Support & Maintenance contract which also gives access to a number of other Support & Maintenance services. List Price of the Standard Support & Maintenance contract is calculated at a yearly rate of 20% of the License Fee list price. 

* POC: Proof of Concept in customer environment

* Professional Services: Evidian delivers a specific catalog of professional services for all these operations.</p>
