# Business Models
A business model describes the process followed by an organization to create, deliver and capture value for its customers. This process is commonly represented by a framework that organizations use as tools to develop and define the different elements that take part in the process and the interactions between them. Among the different approaches available, one of the most popular is the framework proposed by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2009), resulting in the Business Model Canvas. The Business Model Canvas is organized around nine different elements: value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, cost structure and revenue streams.
The Business Model Canvas proposed by Osterwalder and Pigneur was later adapted by Ash Maurya (2010) into the Lean Canvas. This framework modifies some of the elements of the Business Model Canvas to open it to start-ups, small and large organizations. Thus, the Lean Canvas conserves some of the elements from the Business Model Canvas (customers, channels, cost structure, revenue streams), omits others (key activities and key resources, customer relationships and key partners) and introduces new ones: problem, solution, key metrics and unfair advantage:

* Problem: it is essential to understand in the first place what are the problems and needs that the solution you are proposing is addressing and solving for your existing/potential customers, including the existing alternatives available.

* Customer segments: these are the different groups of existing and potential customers that share similar problems and needs to be solved and met by the solution created by the organization.

* Solution: This element gives an answer to the customer segments for the problems and needs identified.

* Unique Value Proposition: this element explains how the solution proposed will create value to the customers.

* Unfair Advantage: this element describes the competitive advantage that the organization possesses that cannot be copied nor bought.

* Channels: this element covers the means for the delivery of value (the solution) to the customer segments (including promotion and distribution).

* Key Metrics: this element includes all the metrics that the organization will use to monitor and measure the performance and success.

* Cost structure: this element represents the financial infrastructure required to support the creation and delivery of value to the customers.

* Revenue streams: this element represents the mechanisms and sources for financing and capturing value as a result of the delivery of the solution.
