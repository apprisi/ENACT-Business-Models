      <b>Problem</b>
      <p>New generation of IoT applications are  not only for data collecting on the field but also to control  actuation systems.  They become critical system and need  tools to detect and manage actuation conflic and toward more trustworthlyness. </p>
      <b>Existing Alternatives</b>
      <p>Currently actuation systems are controlled with Ad-Hoc monitors. These approaches are not well-adapted for Devops methodology and  large scale IoT platforms</p>

      <b>Solution</b>
      <p>Tools to detect actuation conflicts, to design actuation managers, to monitor behavioral drift  of the actuation systems.</p>

      <b>Unfair Advantage</b>
      <p>New algorithms and models for Knowledge contribution, Open Source (Lesser General Public License) and legacy proprietary Software for prototyping</p>

      <p> 
* Licence agreements for transfer (key metric = sum of %) 
   - 50 % licences on actuation conflict manager tools 
   - 50 % licences on Behavioral Drift Analysis tools

* Communications  & publications (key metric = sum of %) 
   ** 20% = 2 communications in major conferences (on both CNRS contributions)
   **  50% = 1 journal  publication on Actuation Conflict in IoT  Survey and contribution ,
   -  30 % = 4 communciations with the other partners  (ex. with UDE on reinforcement learning  with behavioral drift measure ...)

* Standard committees : (key metric = sum of %) 
    - 40% = participation to a Specification Groups on IoT plateforms, (ex. ETSI / SmartM2M ...)
    - 60% = standard  draft on  guidelines  for  IoT plateforms and  Actuation  
* Training (key metric = sum of %) 
   -  50% = Online New Course on Devops for IoT (Master degree level) 
   -  40% = Hackaton  on ENACT solutions
